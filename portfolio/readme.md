This is my portfolio website, and ill update and improve it as i aquire more skills.
Its not the prettiest, but it works.
I wanted to make the website very simple, and make it easy for people to find what they want.
I have changed the colour scheme on the advice of charlie, and moved the whole website to a single page because the second page felt empty of content.
